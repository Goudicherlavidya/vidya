# Sign-Language-Recognition Using Machine LEarning
The Sign Language Recognition system is a machine learning-based project developed to bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and the general public. This project uses computer vision and supervised learning techniques to recognize hand gestures from the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet and convert them into readable text in real-time.

Objectives:

Enable real-time recognition of sign language gestures.

Provide a text-based output for each recognized hand sign.

Improve accessibility and promote inclusivity using AI.

How it Works:

Data Collection
A dataset of hand gesture images representing ASL alphabets is used. This includes thousands of images captured under various lighting conditions and hand orientations.

Preprocessing
Images are resized, normalized, and augmented (rotation, flip, contrast adjustment) to improve model robustness.

Model Training
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to classify the input images into one of the 26 alphabets (A-Z). The CNN architecture includes:

Convolutional layers for feature extraction

Max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction

Dense layers for classification

ReLU and Softmax activation functions

Real-time Prediction
Using OpenCV and a webcam, the model takes live input from the userâ€™s hand gesture, processes the frame, and displays the predicted character on screen in real time.

Technologies Used:

Python

OpenCV

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook (for model training)

Key Features:

Real-time gesture recognition using webcam

High accuracy with trained CNN model

Scalable for adding dynamic gesture-based word recognition

Can be integrated into assistive communication apps or devices

Future Scope:

Extend to support dynamic gestures (like "hello" or "thank you")

Convert recognized signs into spoken audio output

Build a mobile app for portable sign translation

Add multilingual support for regional sign languages
